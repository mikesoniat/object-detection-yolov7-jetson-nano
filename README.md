Object Detection with Jetson Nano and YOLO v7

This repository includes my PowerPoint presentation, which describes the software libraries used, as well as step by step instructions on how to install YOLOv7 on the Jetson Nano. I've also included my source files (photos and video) and the detected files with yolo results.
